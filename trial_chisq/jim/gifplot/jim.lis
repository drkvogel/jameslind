       The  information  in  this man page is an extract from the
       full documentation of the GNU  Fortran  compiler  (version
       0.5.24),  and  is  limited  to  the meaning of some of the
       options.

       This man page is not up to date, since no volunteers  want
       to maintain it.  If you find a discrepancy between the man
       page and the software, please check the Info  file,  which
       is the authoritative documentation.

       If  we  find that the things in this man page that are out
       of date cause significant confusion or complaints, we will
       stop distributing the man page.  The alternative, updating
       the man page when we update the Info file, is  impractical
       because  the  rest  of the work of maintaining GNU Fortran
       leaves us no time for that.  The GNU project  regards  man
       pages  as  obsolete and should not let them take time away
       from other things.

       For complete and current documentation, refer to the  Info
       file  `gg7777'  or  the  manual _U_s_i_n_g _a_n_d _P_o_r_t_i_n_g _G_N_U _F_o_r_t_r_a_n
       _(_f_o_r _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _0_._5_._2_4_).  Both  are  made  from  the  Texinfo
       source file gg7777..tteexxii.

       If  your system has the `iinnffoo' command installed, the com­
       mand `iinnffoo gg7777' should work, unless gg7777 has not been prop­
       erly  installed.  If your system lacks `iinnffoo', or you wish
       to  avoid  using   it   for   now,   the   command   `mmoorree
       //uussrr//iinnffoo//gg7777..iinnffoo**'  should work, unless gg7777 has not been
       properly installed.

       If gg7777 has not been properly installed, so that you cannot
       easily access the Info file for it, ask your system admin­
       istrator, or the installer of gg7777 (if you  know  who  that
       is) to fix the problem.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  C  and F77 compilers are integrated; gg7777 is a program
       to call ggcccc with options to recognize programs written  in
       Fortran (ANSI FORTRAN 77, also called F77).  ggcccc processes
       input files through one or more of  four  stages:  prepro­
       cessing,  compilation,  assembly,  and  linking.  This man
       page contains  full  descriptions  for  _o_n_l_y  F77-specific
       aspects of the compiler, though it also contains summaries
       of some general-purpose options.  For a fuller explanation
       of the compiler, see ggcccc(11).

       For  complete  documentation  on  GNU  Fortran, type `iinnffoo
       gg7777'.

       F77 source files use the suffix `..ff', `..ffoorr',  or  `..FFOORR';
       F77  files  to  be  preprocessed  by ccpppp(11) use the suffix
       `..FF', `..ffpppp', or  `..FFPPPP';  Ratfor  source  files  use  the
       suffix  `..rr' (though rraattffoorr itself is not supplied as part
       of gg7777).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       There are many command-line options, including options  to
       control details of optimization, warnings, and code gener­
       ation, which are common to both ggcccc  and  gg7777.   For  full
       information on all options, see ggcccc(11).

       Options  must  be  separate: `--ddrr' is quite different from
       `--dd --rr '.

       Most `--ff' and `--WW' options have two contrary forms: --ff_n_a_m_e
       and  --ffnnoo--_n_a_m_e  (or  --WW_n_a_m_e  and --WWnnoo--_n_a_m_e). Only the non-
       default forms are shown here.


       --cc     Compile or assemble the source files,  but  do  not
              link.  The compiler output is an object file corre­
              sponding to each source file.

       --DD_m_a_c_r_o
              Define macro _m_a_c_r_o with the string `11' as its defi­
              nition.

       --DD_m_a_c_r_o==_d_e_f_n
              Define macro _m_a_c_r_o as _d_e_f_n.

       --EE     Stop  after the preprocessing stage; do not run the
              compiler proper.  The output is preprocessed source
              code, which is sent to the standard output.

       --gg     Produce debugging information in the operating sys­
              tem's native format (for DBX or SDB or DWARF).  GDB
              also  can work with this debugging information.  On
              most systems that use DBX format, `--gg' enables  use
              of  extra  debugging  information that only GDB can
              use.

              Unlike most other Fortran  compilers,  GNU  Fortran
              allows  you  to  use `--gg' with `--OO'.  The shortcuts
              taken by optimized code  may  occasionally  produce
              surprising results: some variables you declared may
              not exist at all; flow of control may briefly  move
              where  you  did  not expect it; some statements may
              not  be  executed  because  they  compute  constant
              results  or their values were already at hand; some
              statements may execute in different places  because
              they were moved out of loops.

              Nevertheless  it proves possible to debug optimized
              output.  This makes it reasonable to use the  opti­
              mizer for programs that might have bugs.

       --II_d_i_r    Append  directory  _d_i_r to the list of directories
              searched for include files.

       --LL_d_i_r   Add directory _d_i_r to the list of directories to be
              searched for `--ll'.

       --ll_l_i_b_r_a_r_y
               Use the library named _l_i_b_r_a_r_y when linking.

       --nnoossttddiinncc
              Do  not  search the standard system directories for
              header  files.   Only  the  directories  you   have
              specified  with  --II options (and the current direc­
              tory, if appropriate) are searched.

       --OO     Optimize.  Optimizing  compilation  takes  somewhat
              more  time, and a lot more memory for a large func­
              tion.  See the GCC documentation for further  opti­
              misation  options.   Loop unrolling, in particular,
              may be worth investigating  for  typical  numerical
              Fortran programs.

       --oo _f_i_l_e
               Place output in file _f_i_l_e.

       --SS     Stop  after the stage of compilation proper; do not
              assemble.  The output is an assembler code file for
              each non-assembler input file specified.

       --UU_m_a_c_r_o
              Undefine macro _m_a_c_r_o.

       --vv     Print  (on standard error output) the commands exe­
              cuted to run the stages of compilation.  Also print
              the  version  number of the compiler driver program
              and of the preprocessor and  the  compiler  proper.
              The  version numbers of g77 itself and the GCC dis­
              tribution on which it is based are distinct.

       --WWaallll  Issue warnings  for  conditions  which  pertain  to
              usage  that  we  recommend  avoiding  and  that  we
              believe is easy to avoid, even in conjunction  with
              macros.
