From `clink.sh`, files involved are:

simplerand2_c.c (includes `simplerand2_results.c`)
simplerand2_f.f
getseed.f
libg2c.so.0

The first screen, in `simplerand2_c.c`, shows you the explanation and a form that takes a single integer value (should check for non-int). 
Previous versions may have included a text field for a custom condition which defaults to "Very anxious".
