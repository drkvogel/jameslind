# James Lind Library interactive demonstrations

Some interactive demos for the James Lind Library website - http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/

Commissioned by Sir Iain Chalmers and created by Jim Halsey and Chris Bird at CTSU, Oxford


## History

These interactive demonstrations were developed in 2004 for Sir Iain Chalmers to be linked to from the 
the James Lind Library website - http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/. 

http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/ has a link to http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/external/jameslind/simplerand/simplerand3.cgi

## Migration

http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/ has a link to http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/external/jameslind/simplerand/simplerand3.cgi which no longer works as expected.

http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/external/ was a folder on the old webserver, `rum.ctsu.ox.ac.uk`, to serve web assets developed at CTSU but linked to from other sites.

Fry-IT Ltd took over maintenance and development of the CTSU website which was previously managed with Plone CMS and now use Haiku, Fry-IT's own Content Management System based on Plone.

The URL http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/external/jameslind/simplerand/simplerand3.cgi is now unrecognised by Haiku and gives a 404 Not Found error.

The old site has been archived on [port 9000 of rum](http://rum.ctsu.ox.ac.uk:9000/external/jameslind/simplerand/simplerand3.cgi) (accessible only from within the NDPH network), and also, `simplerand3.cgi` has [been migrated](http://gas.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/jameslind/simplerand/simplerand3.cgi) onto a new server, `gas.ndph.ox.ac.uk`.
 which is visible to the outside world.

However, a decision has been made to end support of this application by creating a new, JavaScript-based version which can be bundled and sent to the James Lind Library for them to host themselves.

Hence JS-Lind.
